### Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview
For this assignment, we used all resources at our disposal and the provided LoanStats_2019Q1.csv in order to help identify if individuals may be low or high risk status for a credit loan.

Using credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, we over and under-sampled the data using RandomOverSampler, SMOTE, and the ClusterCentroids algorithms. We then used a combination of over and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm.

The next task completed was to compare two machine learning models that reduce bias to predict credit risk. These algorithms being BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier.
